                in the webbrowser, edit <code>sitename:</code> in the configuration file.

# Pages can be used for the more 'static' pages on your site. This content-type
# has a 'templateselect' field, which allows you to override the record_template
# setting for an individual page.
# The taxonomy for this ContentType is defined as 'groups', which is a so-called
# "grouping taxonomy". This way you can easily group sets of pages that logically
# belong together. If your site has a 'services' section, in which you'd like to
# list the different types of services a company provides, you can group these
# together.

# The 'Blocks' ContentType is a so-called 'resource ContentType'. This means
# that it can be used to manage smaller pieces of content, like the 'about us'
# text, an 'our address' in the footer, or similar short blurbs of text.
